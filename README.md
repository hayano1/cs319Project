# cs319Project
Hello all
This is the cs319 term project repository. In here we (cs319 group) will post everything related to the project, starting from all paperwork, to ideas, sketches and code. Our project consists of building an IQ Puzzler Pro* kind of game, in which the aim is to properly  place a number of puzzle pieces in their appropriate slot to form a pyramid. The puzzle pieces come in different shapes, forms and color.This game will have various levels and difficulties with difficulties increasing as the levels increase. The game will be coded in Java as agreed by the members of the group.For now we have a 2D model in mind which can be further developed in the future to 3D.
